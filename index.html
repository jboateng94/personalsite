                  A creative, good-natured and eccentric character with self-possession, who can approach tasks with composure and gets results. I can work well within a team as well as being organised to complete tasks on my own, with good communication skills. I also harbor the ability to make decisions with confidence either in a team or individually.

                  Eastern Enterprise Games Hub (Extra-curricular) – November 2014 to May 2015

                  Leading a team with five others, we created a demo for a game of our own invention over six months using the Unity 3D Engine. During this time I was appointed the role of project leader, which involved gathering the team for meetings, to discuss any actions we should take to progress the game’s development. I also acted as one of the team’s programmers, coding our main character’s movement and camera controls.

                  Royal Voluntary Service – Hillingdon (Volunteer)

                  Worked as part of a team to organize a get-together for the elderly in the Hillingdon area. This was to help encourage social interaction with other members within the community. My role involved inviting guests by going door-to-door promoting for the event. This experience has helped improve my confidence, persuasion skills and determination.
